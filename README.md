 Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly superposition and entanglement, to process information in ways that classical computers cannot.
Qubits: Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform many calculations at once.
For certain problems, quantum computers have the potential to solve them exponentially faster than classical computers. For example, they could significantly improve tasks like factoring large numbers or searching unsorted databases.
Quantum computing is still in the experimental stage. While companies and research institutions are making progress, scalable and practical quantum computers are yet to be realized.
